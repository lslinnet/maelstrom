Depends
... on a lot of stuff, like:
   * timecloud [https://www.ohloh.net/projects/timecloud]
   * python, 
   * php,
   * javascript,
   * sqlite3, 

HOWTO
 0. Create a db/ directory in the root of the maelstrom distribution.
 1. Get utils/indexer.py to run on your mbox or cyrus mail files. This will
 create a message.db sqlite database containing all information from the
 headers of the mails parsed.
 2. Configure an apache/php stack to the stuff in the www directory.
 3. If the mails all belong to one person, you should set the MAILBOXOWNER
 variable in www/maelstrom.php
 4. direct your browser to http://<wherever-you-configured-it>/contacts.php
 or to http://<wherever-you-configured-it>/cnet.php?c=<name of contact>

have fun, s.
